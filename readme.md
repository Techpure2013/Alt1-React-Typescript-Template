You can open `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser and it will give some basic functionality based one pasted images.
You can easily add components to your application through `https://ui.shadcn.com/` or use a Component library Mantine which supports "react": "^18.2.0"
You can also open it in the Alt1 browser and click the `add app` button that appears to get some basic alt1 functionality.
